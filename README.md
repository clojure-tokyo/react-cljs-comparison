# react-cljs-comparison

This is a small repo to evaluate ReactJS interfaces in ClojureScript during our
[clojure.tokyo meetup](https://www.meetup.com/clojure-tokyo/) sessions.
The most popular interfaces are Om and Reagent but there are other libraries
we can try and compare:

- Om: https://github.com/omcljs/om
- Reagent: https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent
- Quiescent: https://github.com/levand/quiescent
- Rum: https://github.com/tonsky/rum
- Brutha: https://github.com/weavejester/brutha
